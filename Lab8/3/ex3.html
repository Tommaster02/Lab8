    <p>The Shy</p>
    <p>TheShy was a member of Anarchy in 2014, but in November he joined Team WE as a streamer. He stayed with them until May of 2017, when he left and joined Invictus Gaming as their alternate top laner. The team's Summer Season was similar to their Spring Season and they finished 3rd with a 10-6 record. They did much better in the playoffs and finished 3rd with a victory over Team WE in the third place match. IG then participated in the 2017 Season China Regional Finals, but failed to make it to Worlds after Team WE got their revenge against them and beat them 3-2.
